# Finding Analytical Talent - What You Don't Know About Working With Universities - Camm

## Notes

- How can industry and academia work together?
- Talent gap: what industries needs or is looking for vs what universities are providing for
- DS vs DA vs BA
    + Labels matter, especially when you're shopping for
- Analytics: problem focused, Data Science: data focused
- Growth in analytics, data science programs over time
    + NC State has good data on this
- Four things universities want from collaborators
    + Advisory boards, journals (want to publish things from work with companies), experiential learning, funding
- Three things companies want from universities
    + Talent, alternative insights/new approaches/relatively novel methods, community engagement
- New approaches
    + Universities have experts and can deploy them to companies with limited resources
- Community engagement
    + Advisory board, scholarships, co-branding
- Analytics Talent Issues
- [Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/inte.2018.0955) shows that communication, interpersonal, and managerial skills are desired in analytics/data science job ads. Much higher percentage with these skills than the technical skills
    + STEM majors are introverts and "look at their feet when they're talking"
    + Inability to turn data into insights (domain knowledge, creativity, translating data, professionalism)
    + Lack of appropriate analytical skills (technical)
- Faculty consulting
- Faculty/student research
- Amazon Scholars Programs
- Intellectual property issue


## Key Takeways

- This was immediately after lunch, so my attention was not very focused.
- Need to think from both sides of the picture: what can academia gain from working with a business and what can the business gain from working with academia
    + Similar goals, but the differences between the two sides are important to balance
- Collaboration is important
