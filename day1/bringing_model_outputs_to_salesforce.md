# The Last Mile - Bringing Model Outputs to Your Sales Force - Pylpiw & Quillin
 
## Notes 
 
- Corporate sales
    + Acquire customers (communicate value and provide better rates/benefits)
    + Retain customers (trusted advisor, help customer understand their business)
    + Grow/Maintain
- Southwest's porftolio is growing, how to prioritize customer outreach?
    + Categorized by customer size
    + Categorization was successful: new agreements, increase in trips, increase in revenue
- Classification was size/spend based and this was working
    + Didn't want to replace this approach, but add layers on top of this method
- Models
    + Million dollar lookalike model
        * logit, behavior based attributes, identfied small/medium sized accounts which acted like large accounts
        * So what: why does the account look like large company?
            - behaviors
            - growth
            - market share not captured by Sotuhwest
    + Account segmentation
        * K-Means, behavior based attributes, methods for tailored tactics
    + Growth forecasts
        * time series and regression, historical, seasonal, behavioral attributes
        * Better annual operating plan (growth/decline? engagement change?) and account prioritization
        * Use data-driven results to investigate companies
- Translating data into insights for sales managers
    + Full spectrum of data literacy in sales managers
- Keys for sales manager success
    + Preparation (know your stuff)
    + Confidence (in the data and its implications)
    + Business knowledge (know what's going on in the world)
- How to empower sales team with the knowledge they need without overwhelming them?
- Quick start guides
    + Top 10 list (__best adoption__)
        * Accounts flagged for various models
        * Ton of detail for these accounts, pdf
    + Current events "story" for select accounts
        * What are some current news events for the accounts?
    + Insights for every account in Account Manager portfolio
        * Give them all the data if they want it
- Took same data and used it to communicate with companies themselves
    + Congrats on new acquisition
    + Sign up for Rapid Rewards
- How did they measure the impact of this initiative?
    + Wanted sales managers to be __prepared__, __confident__, and __knowledgeable__. They took surveys to measure these qualitative components.
- Key learnings
    + Spend alone will only get you so far
    + You shouldn't have to be a data scientist to utilize insights
        * Specifics on how the model outputs were communicate
    + Start small, slowly remove scaffolding
        * People gravitate to lists
    + Don't forget to ask for feedback

## Key Takeaways 
 
- Not just enough to build model, need to answer the So What? question for each model
- Insights need to be delivered in an easy-to-consume document, like a playbook
- Might not be able to directly measure impact of data-driven guidance using KPIs. They used surveys.
- Main data product was a pdf for an account manager's top 10 accounts, giving insight into what's moving the needle.
    + Top 10 accounts list was based on being flagged by model outputs
- People gravitate to lists
    + Frog in water
- Multiple sources of truth
    + Getting ahead of this, emphasizing why there were differences with caveats. No claims that their deliverable was the ultimate truth.
- Shadow databases
    + Sales managers have incentive to use freshest data, rather than keeping files
