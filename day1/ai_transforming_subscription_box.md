# The Top 7 Ways AI is Transforming the Subscription Box Industry [A Fortune 200 Case Study] - Bennett 
 
## Notes 
 
- 60% of reasons people use subscription boxes involve AI
- Seven reaons
    + Data driven onboarding
        * Gathering important information early
        * What if everyone says the same thing?
    + Product recommenders
        * Personalization at scale
    + Advertising to segments
        * Informed advertising
        * Discover groups who act similarly
    + Box completion/up-sell/add-on
    + Marketing and communications
    + Retention
    + Swap-Out
- Onboarding
    + DayN models inform customer opportunity
    + Neutral/extreme onboarding questions are useless
    + Factorization-based recommender coefficients inform better questions
- Recommenders
    + Provide a ranked, personalized, list of products for any given customers
    + Popularity bias: hard to beat
- In the beginning, segmented popularity is hard to beat
- Very important to choose the right objective function
    + What is our measure of success?
    + What is the dependent variable?
    + Sometimes it's just a proxy
- Testing beats offline optimization
- Seasonality and demographics really matter
- Price-sensitive groups demonstrate different purchasing behavior
    + Multiple correspondence analysis
- Upsell
    + Market basket analysis and association rule mining
        * Trivial to understand and easy to implement

- Swap-Out
    + Replace #1 item with another of similar look and price

Guidance on successful data science positions/roles/teams: ownership and credit, eduction, mentorship

- Make it easy to deploy AI models quickly (reduce deployment time)
    + Make sure devops understand exactly what they're deploying 
    + `load_model`, `fit`, `predict`
    + A model is a set of coefficients
- Increase team throughput
    + Aggregate data into roll-ups that serve data science better
        * Items, Users, Interactions
- Showcase data science know-how
    + Make shareable visualizations to break barriers
    + Easier cross-team understanding of data science initiatives
    + Greater feeling of ownership for data scientists
    + Show your products
        * Parameterize stuff
        * make an AJAX app
- Increase # of group projects/involvements
    + No more solo data scientists
- Have frequent reviews

## Key Takeaways 
 
- Objective function is one of the most important technical concepts in data science
    + Pair objective to metric
    + Doing something is better than doing nothing
        * Get the first big chunk done (most lift) then try and get the next 5%
    + Start simple (logistic regression) and move to something more complicated if warranted (xgboost)
- Recommendation systems are worth a deeper examination
