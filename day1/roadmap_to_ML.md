# Creating a Roadmap to Machine Learning and Beyond: Key Learnings from Recent Case Studies - Ramirez
 
## Notes 
 
- Starting with a data science strategic roadmap
    + Strategic plan
    + Centralized data science expertise
    + Value creation
    + Collaborative platform
    + Launch and execute
- Key to success: have a plan
    + Plan -> Do -> Check -> Act cycle
- Accelerate your progress by accelerating your speed
    + Quickly prototype products in quick sprints
        * Not just sprint, but learn from the sprints
- Key components
    + Current state analysis, stakeholder enegagement, IT infrastructure, policy and procedure, deployment, training and enablement
- Important to assess current data/reports and gaps
    + Can we better map what data we DO have?
- Human-centered design principles
    + Technology, process, talent, and data building blocks
 
## Key Takeaways 

- Last session of the day, low ability to focus and concentrate 
- Ask a lot of questions for stakeholders
- Don't be afraid of starting at the lowest level of the pyramid (data acquisition) and mapping the way to the highest level (analytics/ML/data science)
    + Identify the gaps and fill them in
- Roadmap to AI
    + Develop a set of use cases that lead to a portfolio of POC projects
        * what could be possible?
        * Agile, close to stakeholders, current state analysis, project progress tracking
    + Rapidly iterate
- Build capacity across the lifecycle, skipping steps, start with a strategy or measure of success (not with the data you have in hand)
- Be patient and trust the process
