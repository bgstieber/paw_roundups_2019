# Embedding Analytics in Your Front Line - Panel Discussion
 
## Notes 

- Business-focused design and implementation
- Understand customer pain points
    + What is the business requirement for the end user?
- Help the business frame the problem
- How to convince the business that the result of the model makes sense and is reasonable?
    + Need trust and a proper understanding of the business and its questions
- Need to do the ROI calculations ahead of time
    + What type of outcomes is the business looking for?
    + Communicate in terms of business values rather than analytic value
        * How does a new model help to bring in more dollars? Can communicate in terms of % lift, but what about $ lift?
- A data science project is a journey (involving education), not just handing over some code
    + Good to listen to the business first, then the data
- Bad idea: solution in search of a problem
- Data engineering
    + Data engineering priorities should match business priorities
    + Should the data scientist completely own the data engineering pipeline?
    + Should at least all fit under the umbrella?
- Expectation (bad) is that business will come to you. This is wrong, data scientists should reach out to the business.
    + Four competencies: stats, engineering, communication, management
 
## Key Takeaways 

- This hit on one of the major themes of the sessions I attended: determine the measure of success (target variable) and how it should be considered (loss function)
- Accuracy is not the _only_ metric that should be looked at. The business has many additional priorities.
- Model maintenance and "continuous" improvement with ML models might be counter-intuitive for IT teams
