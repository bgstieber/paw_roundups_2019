# The Perils of Prediction - Chen
 
## Notes 

- Humans and machines are equally susceptible to censored information
- Models
    + imitiate past not future
    + cannt remove human bias
    + once embedded, bias is difficult to remove
- Vicious cycle (your data is being influenced by your model)
    + Base rate fallacy
    + Attribution fallacy
- Spurious correlations
- Obvious to oblivious
    + Replicating distribution
    + Data leakage
- Accuracy and overiftting are two sides of same coin
    + Overfitting is fitting to the residuals
- Complexity bias
 
## Key Takeaways 
 
- 2 points is a line, 3 points is a trend
