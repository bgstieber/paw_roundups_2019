# Thoughts from PAW 2019

## Themes

- Operationalizing models
    + What should the handoff look like?
    + What _are_ models?
    + Continuous improvement of an ML model might be counter-intuitive for IT teams
- Defining what's important, and acting on it
    + Target variable (how is success measured)
    + Loss function (how will we compare success)
    + Business value of data science product
        * Predictive accuracy is not the _only_ metric, and it is most likely not the _primary_ metric for the business
        * Do not build solutions in search of problems
- The percent of time data scientists spend on data prep is still strictly greater than 50% (I heard 60, 90, and __even 99%!__)
    + Some of this can be solved with automation
